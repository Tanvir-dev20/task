# üìù Flutter Notes App (GetX + Clean Architecture)

A simple note-taking application built with **Flutter**, **GetX**, and **Clean Architecture**.  
The app stores notes locally in **SharedPreferences** and works in **offline-first** mode.  
When the device has internet connectivity, notes are automatically synced to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) via POST.
